<p>     While reading Kate Wagner's essay, "404 Page Not Found," I reflected on my experiences with the internet compared to Wagner's. I was astonished at how Wagner grew up with the internet as a kid when they were five years old in 1998 and saw it develop as they grew older. Even though I never grew up with the internet during its early stages, I can understand the feelings of nostalgia and the importance the internet had for Wagner by how they lovingly speak about GeoCities. The author, Kate Wagner, often mentions how the early internet and the creation of GeoCities were accessible to amateurs, which allowed for unique individual customizable web pages. Wagner also mentioned how gifs, images, old text, and backgrounds played a part in customization for personal web pages and large groups in the early internet for amateurs. Lastly, Wagner mentions how different it was to interact with the early internet as it required time to look for things compared to now, where we can type in a few keywords and find what we're looking for.</p>
<p>     However, while reading Kate Wagner's essay, there was a part that caught my attention, which was under the Facebook vs. Tweens subsection. According to Kate Wagner, "As with many consumer products, Facebook's aspirational bent aligned with user's desire to achieve, or retain, professional class status." In Wagner's essay, they mentioned how Facebook was first introduced to Harvard, then Ivy League schools, and lastly, high schools. Based on the material in Wagner's essay, Facebook attempted to create a divide between people in social media by creating a status or image for people. The idea of creating a social status on social media sounded confusing because instead of separating people to a certain status, why not make everyone equal from the beginning?</p>
<p>     I understand there was a debate between individuals using Myspace and Facebook during the early 2000s, but I found it strange how people would consider Facebook the better option in any scenario. Based on Wagner's experience, Myspace had more creative freedom with its customization, while Facebook was considered more professional due to its simplistic look. Even though users had their differences between each social website, it all depended on what they were searching for. Although its difficult to imagine Facebook or any social media app retaining someone with a professional status in 2025 simply because they use it. In the present day in 2025, social media is seen as a source of entertainment instead of depicting someone's social status. As there are several growing platforms like TikTok and Instagram, more people tend to share videos, images, and ideas on social media.</p>
<p>     Looking back at the terms web 1.0 and web 2.0, made me question if one was better than the other one. For example, web 1.0 encouraged amateurs with creativity for their personal or group web pages in the early 2000s, although it was more tedious to access or find certain things of interest. However, compared to web 2.0, which offered a more simplistic look but restricted access, made their design more user-friendly. Both web 1.0 and web 2.0 have their advantages and disadvantages. If I were to choose between web 1.0 or web 2.0, I would pick web 1.0. The reason I chose web 1.0 is simply due to its engagement. I feel as if being able to create and engage with others by creating websites is a valuable skill to learn compared to using popular companies' applications. While the applications are helpful for everyday contact and entertainment, they do seem to be repetitive in the sense of following strict guidelines.</p>
